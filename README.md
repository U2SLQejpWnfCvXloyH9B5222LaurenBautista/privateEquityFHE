# Private Equity Tokenization: A DeFi Protocol for Confidential Trading

This project is a DeFi protocol that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to enable the tokenization and trading of private equity securely and privately. Designed specifically for the private equity market, our platform transforms traditional investment practices into a compliant, confidential, and efficient digital experience. 

## Addressing the Blind Spots in Private Equity

The private equity market often faces challenges such as lack of transparency, high levels of risk due to information asymmetry, and limited access for investors. Traditional methods of trading private equity can expose sensitive business information and lead to concerns over compliance and investor privacy, causing a slowdown in market growth.

## The FHE Advantage

The use of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption** revolutionizes how we address these problems. By implementing Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, we ensure that sensitive equity data is encrypted and remains private during its entire lifecycle—from tokenization to trading—allowing only qualified investors to participate while maintaining regulatory compliance. This approach not only augments privacy but also enhances trust and transparency within the private equity market.

## Core Functionalities

Here are the key features that make our platform unique:

- **FHE-Encryped Equity Information**: All private equity data is securely encrypted, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential throughout tokenization and trading processes.
- **Qualified Investor Participation**: Trading is exclusive to qualified investors, conforming to regulatory standards while fostering a secure trading environment.
- **Efficiency & Transparency**: Achieve a significant boost in the efficiency of transactions and transparency in the private equity market, allowing for a more fluid trading experience.
- **Privacy-First Infrastructure**: Business secrets and sensitive data are preserved, making the trading of illiquid assets less risky for businesses and investors alike.
- **Interoperability with Other DeFi Assets**: Seamlessly interact with other DeFi applications, enhancing liquidity and trading opportunities.

## Technology Stack

Our platform is built using a combination of different technologies to ensure robust performance and security. Here are the main components:

- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity for secure token transactions.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For the frontend interface and interactions with smart contracts.
- **Zama FHE SDK (Concrete, TFHE-rs)**: For implementing the FHE solutions crucial to our protocol.
- **Node.js**: For our server-side operations.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For testing and deploying smart contracts.

## Project Structure

To help you navigate the codebase, here's the directory structure of the project:

```
.
├── contracts
│   └── privateEquityFHE.sol
├── scripts
│   ├── deploy.js
│   └── interact.js
├── test
│   └── privateEquityFHE.test.js
├── src
│   ├── index.js
│   └── components
│       ├── TokenForm.js
│       └── InvestorDashboard.js
└── package.json
```

## Getting Started

To set up the project, you must have **Node.js** and **Hardhat/Foundry** installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository manually** without the use of `git clone` or similar commands.  
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will fetch the required Zama FHE libraries and additional dependencies.

## Building and Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can proceed with compiling and testing the smart contracts followed by launching the application:

1. Compile the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Finally, start the server to access the application interface:

   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```
